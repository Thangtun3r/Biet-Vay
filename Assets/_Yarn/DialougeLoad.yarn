He turns off the phone, heads downstairs, and notices a Nintendo Switch sitting on the table.
He hesitates, then picks it up and slips it into his bag.
(The Nintendo Switch is now stored.)

Player: How long have you been waiting?

Player: Okay, let’s go.
Inside the mall…
Crush: This mall… we used to come here all the time with our friends in high school. Those were such fun days.
[[Player: Yeah, I remember. We even skipped class once to come here just to play the gachapon machines.|InsideMallLine2]]

Player: Yeah, I remember. We even skipped class once to come here just to play the gachapon machines.
Crush: Haha, we really shouldn’t have done that. I got scolded by my dad so much after that.
[[Player: Well, at least we got that SSR item from the gacha. Worth it, 100%.|InsideMallLine3]]

Player: Well, at least we got that SSR item from the gacha. Worth it, 100%.
Crush: Fair trade—a sore butt for a rare item.
Crush: We’ve been walking around for almost 30 minutes. Do you have any suggestions on where to go next?
[[Player: How about we watch a movie?|MovieScene]]
[[Player: How about we get something to eat?|MovieScene]]

# (Any of the above choices all lead here)
Crush: Sure, let’s go. I was actually planning to invite you to watch the new Mizenky movie too.
During the movie, the theater is dim and quiet.
Crush: (whispering) Wow, the lead actress is stunning.
[[Player: Kind of like you, though.|AfterMovieLine1]]

Player: Kind of like you, though.
Crush: …
An awkward silence lingers before they return their focus to the movie.
After the movie ends, they step out together.
[[Player: Honestly, that movie was terrible. The CGI was absurd.|AfterMovieLine2]]

Player: Honestly, that movie was terrible. The CGI was absurd.
Crush: (smirking) Well, at least they had a stunning actress… like me, right?
He glances at him teasingly.
[[Player: Why don’t we walk for a bit?|ParkWalkLine1]]

Player: Why don’t we walk for a bit?
Crush: Sure, let’s go.
They wander slowly, the evening breeze carrying a nostalgic feeling.
Crush: This park is so nostalgic. Remember when we went to that bar when we were underage? They had those ridiculous seats shaped like butts.
[[Player: Yeah. And remember the time we tried to rescue that kitten, but you accidentally bumped into that scary gang-looking guy? You looked like you were about to cry.|ParkWalkLine2]]

Player: Yeah. And remember the time we tried to rescue that kitten, but you accidentally bumped into that scary gang-looking guy? You looked like you were about to cry.
Crush: (mock-angry but smiling) Hey!! Don’t remind me!
[[Player: Let’s sit here for a bit to rest. Want to play some Nintendo Switch?|ParkBenchLine1]]

Player: Let’s sit here for a bit to rest. Want to play some Nintendo Switch?
Crush: Whoa, you actually brought it? Sure!
They play for 25 minutes.
[[Player: Haha, you’re a natural, but still far from a pro like me.|ParkBenchLine2]]
===

title: ParkBenchLine2

Player: Haha, you’re a natural, but still far from a pro like me.
Crush: Well, give me some time—I’ll catch up eventually.
They continue strolling through the park for another hour, talking and laughing along the way.
[[Player: Haha, look at Khang. He was so crazy when he tried pulling off that stunt.|QuietBenchLine1]]

Player: Haha, look at Khang. He was so crazy when he tried pulling off that stunt.
Crush: (laughing) I honestly don’t know what you guys were thinking back then.
They swipe to another picture—this time, a photo of just the two of them together, looking much younger.
Crush: Aww, this one’s so cute. We looked so young back then. Time really flies.
[[Player: Hey… there’s something I want to tell you.|Confession1]]

Player: Hey… there’s something I want to tell you.

Crush: … This is… kind of sudden.
Crush: I honestly thought you saw me as just a friend.
Crush: But… thank you. I really appreciate you telling me this. I truly do.
Crush: It’s just… it’s sudden. I need some time to think about it. I’ll let you know soon.
Two days later, his phone buzzes with a new message.
Crush: Hi.
Crush: About the other day…
Crush: After thinking about it a lot…
Crush: I truly value our time together, and I appreciate your confession.
Crush: But… I don’t think I’m ready to go further than friendship.
Crush: I still want to remain friends though.
Crush: Still friends?
[[Player: Yeah… sure.|EndScene]]
